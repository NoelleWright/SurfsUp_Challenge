# SurfsUp_Challenge

The purpose of the challenge was to help W. Avy with an analysis of weather in Hawaii before he opens up a surf shop. The two major months that data was collect4ed from were June and December. An analysis was by using sqlite as well as a python notebook with html code. The data was run through each program to determine the summary statistics of weather temperatures in each month. 

Based upon the results with the data, December had a mean temperature/precipitation score of 1700.0 and December had a mean precipitation score of 1517.0. These resukts determine when it will be better for the surf shop to open based on the precipitation scores between the two months.
